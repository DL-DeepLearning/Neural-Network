# Self organizing map

A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional).

### objective
> -Customized output and input
> -The dimensionality representation like PCA
> -Combined with the current popular neural network framework (i.e. Tensorflow, pytorch..etc)

### tutorial
[AI-Junkie’s post](http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/som/som1.html) does a great job of explaining how an SOM is trained, so I won’t re-invent the wheel.
