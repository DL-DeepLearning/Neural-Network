# Self organizing map

A self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a high-dimensional to low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) feature map.

### objective
 * Customized output and input
 * The dimensionality representation like PCA
 * Combined with the current popular neural network framework (i.e. Tensorflow, Theano, pytorch..etc)

### tutorial
[AI-Junkie’s post](http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/som/som1.html) does a great job of explaining how an SOM is trained, so I won’t re-invent the wheel.
